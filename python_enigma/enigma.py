"""An implementation of the Enigma Machine in Python.

This is a toy project intending to implement the Enigma Machine as originally
designed by Arthur Scherbius. Enigma was an electromechanical implementation of
a polyalphabetic substitution cypher. It's no longer considered
cryptographically secure, but the device itself was fairly interesting.

No effort has been made to correct any of the cryptographic flaws in enigma;
this implementation is meant to be as faithful as possible. Additionally,
steps have been taken to attempt to emulate not just the Wehrmacht enigma, but
the commercial models as well. Additionally while a large number of rotor
bindings can be found in the provided catalog.json, this is not exhaustive,
and the module makes no effort to enforce the use of "matching" rotors.

No interactive mode is explicitly provided for - import into an interactive
interpreter or call with your scriptlets.

Development was by Zac Adam-MacEwen. See the README.md for details.
